 Design : 



# Initialize gloabls 

# user interface design, lite version

# print a title banner, centered

# Enter main()

# user conditional flow

# prompt the user if they will be full time or part time employee

# Display the pay rate, FT and PT workers, + commission per paper delivered

# Display FT paper delivery goal = 100 papers 
# Display PT paper delivery goal = 50 papers 


# Initialize the control flow via prompt comparision (!= == )


# if the user respose is full time - 

  - ask the number of papers they delvered 

  - multiply the FT/PT salary to # of papers delivered

  - add commission

# Display the results back to uer 
# Exit program

# determine if the user is                   result:   : full time 

a part timer or full timer                   expected  : full time 
 
- full timers work 20 hrs a week
- part timers work 10hr

# hours = input("full time or part time worker?n\ ")

>>> full time 
# if (hours == 'full time'):                 result: : part time 

 // full time program activates //           expected : part time  

 else(hours =! 'full time')                    do math 
   // part time program activates//         Finish with weekly salary
