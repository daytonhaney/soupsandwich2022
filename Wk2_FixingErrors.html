<p>Without exception, you, like everyone else will encounter errors when you start developing your program.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at how we go about fixing them. Let's start with code for the Total Pay example discussed in Example 2 of the previous video.</p>
<p>#This program will prompt for hours worked and hourly rate and then calculate the total pay<br>#This code has several bugs.<br>#CMIS Faculty - 3/1/2022 - program used for debugging</p>
<p>Copy and paste this code in the Python editor if you want to try an debug it first before watching the video.</p>
<p><br>def main():<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; #Prompt the user for hours worked<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; hrsWork = input("Please enter your hours worked: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; #Prompt the user for hourly rate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; hrlyRate = eval( input("Please enter your hourly rate: &nbsp;") )</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; #Compute the total pay (hours * rate)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; totalPay = hrsWork * hrlyrate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; #Display the total pay<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("\n Total pay is: &nbsp;", totalPay)</p>
