def main():
    #Declare variables - leftover from C-code - not required for Python
    #int numTires
    #float tirePrice, installPrice, tireCost, installCost, totalCost

    #Initialize variables
    tirePrice = 140.0	# Notice that I'm assigning these values to variables
    installPrice = 5	# These variables will be used in the calculations.

    # Display Welcome message
    print("\nWelcome to Bernie's Tire service program")    #notice the \n  is anew line
    print("\nThis program will calculate the cost of your tire purchase , including installation")

    #Prompt user for number of tires and Get user response
    numTires = int(input("\n How many tires would you like to purchase ? \t    "))   #notice the \t  is a tab

    #Calculate the cost of tires
    tireCost = tirePrice * numTires

    #Calculate the cost if installation
    installCost = installPrice * numTires

    #Calcuate the total cost 
    totalCost = tireCost + installCost

    #Display the output
    print(" The       cost of tires is:          ", tireCost)
    print(" The       cost of installation  is:  ", installCost)
    print(" The Total cost of your purchase is:  ", totalCost)
