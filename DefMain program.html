<p>In the&nbsp; Learning Resources text and videos, the Python commands shown are being executed in a Python shell.</p>
<p>But this is unique to Python and maybe a few other IDE tools. As our programs get larger and more complex, it will become more confusing to follow the flow of your program.</p>
<p>A more conventional approach that is consistent with most other languages is to Define a Main program. This is done with the <strong>def main(): </strong>command and all other code is indented (the same) afterwards. Using this approach will help you keep track of the flow of your program as all code will be inside the main or inside a function(later on). By convention everyone knows that the code starts with the main program.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>def main():</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print("Hello class")</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print("My name is Joe")</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print("My class is CMIS 102/6677")</p>
<p>#However, to the compiler, the above just defines the main program.</p>
<p>#To execute the program, you need ...</p>
<p><strong>main()</strong></p>
<p><strong>#The TireCost programs are written using def main.</strong></p>
